## About The Project

</p>

The fiber arts have been my go-to hobby for many years, and it's not easy finding people and sharing that interest these days. There are many great social media platforms available. However, I couldn't find one that checked all the boxes when it came to my knitting and engaging with friends. There is a site that gets close, Ravelry.com, with an extensive library and user base. I wanted to create a news-feed-style web app that tapped into the existing Ravelry library and allows users to share their project progress, new acquisitions, local yarn shops, and patterns they are interested in making. 

Here's why:
* You should be able to share a project with all it's details during it's creation without having to recreate or summerize it into a genaric post. The fiber arts are filled with long term projects and they 
* You should have all your friends and hobbies in one place and not clogged up by other social media.

### Built With

Yarn Feed was built with ASP.Net framework utilizing the Ravelry API to pull user data and create a post. The web page layout and theming were created with Bootstrap.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet)
* [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/api)



### Installation

This application reqires a pro Ravelry account and api key to access and update user data. 
1. Create account at [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/invitations)
2. Create an App and get your api keys at [here](https://www.ravelry.com/api)
3. Clone the repo
   ```sh

   ```
4. Enter your API in `APIKeys.cs`
   ```JS

   private static string ClientSecret = "ENTER YOUR ClientSecret";
   private static string Username = "ENTER YOUR Username";
   private static string Password = "ENTER YOUR Password";
   ```
